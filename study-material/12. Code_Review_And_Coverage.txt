PMD and Checkstyle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These tools are not competing but are complementary and should be used simultaneously.

The convention type (Checkstyle) is the glue that enables people to work together and 
to free up their creativity instead of spending time and energy at understanding inconsistent code.

Checkstyle examples
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Is there javadoc on public methods?
- Is the project following Sun naming conventions?
- Is the code written with a consistent format?

PMD reminds you bad practices
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://dl.bintray.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/updates/

- Catching an exception without doing anything
- Having dead code
- Too many complex methods
- Direct use of implementations instead of interfaces
- Implementing the hashcode() method without the not equals(Object object) method
